<h1 style="font-size:120%">Welcome!</h1>
<hr class="golden">
<p>You made it! We're so excited you're here.</p>
<p class="poppins" style="font-size:18px">This is what's called a token-gated experience, which you have access to only because you hold a PixelBeast in your Metamask wallet. Isn't that cool?</p>
<p class="poppins" style="font-size:18px">These benefits beyond owning an NFT image is what's called "utility". Why does this matter?</p>
<p class="poppins" style="font-size:18px">PixelBeasts are all about building and playing with utility! In addition to building our own, like this one - we're really excited to collaborate with other builders and be the first ones to test them out.</p>
<p class="poppins" style="font-size:18px">Check in to Beastopia periodically to find out about these new experiences.</p>
